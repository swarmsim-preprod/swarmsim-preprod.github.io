When Swarm Simulator's in a background browser window/tab, automatic FPS uses less of your computer's resources. It's the default if you've never changed your FPS.</li> <li>Some invisible backend changes.</li> <li>Programmers: you can now use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/erosson/swarm-numberformat">Swarm Simulator's number formatting</a> in your own projects.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.61<span>2017/01/11</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a bug that sometimes hid all upgrade levels.</li> <li>Added a note about upgrade notification dropdowns to 'show advanced unit data'.</li> </ul> <h4><a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI" target="_blank" title="So I'm glad I got burned [out] / Think of all the things we learned">1.0.60</a><span>2017/01/10</span></h4> <ul> <li>Added PlayFab-based online saves. Removed Dropbox online saves, which haven't worked for months. (Kongregate players: nothing has changed for you yet.)</li> <li title="?forcefools=[on|after|off]">A certain one-time event now happens every year.</li> <li>Upgrade notification dropdowns are now hidden by default; they confused some newer players. "Show advanced unit data" in the options screen reveals them.</li> <li>Simplified the <a href="/#/contact">developer contact page</a>.</li> <li>Lots of invisible backend changes.</li> </ul> <hr> <h4>1.0.59<span>2015/07/30</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed rounding errors when buying <code>@n</code> units. It should now buy that many or slightly more, but never less.</li> <li title="Mouseover text!">Added a critically import, but mildly secret, feature to inactive mutagen.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.58<span>2015/07/05</span></h4> <ul> <li>The tooltip text for buy-exactly-n units is now more consistent.</li> <li title="Darn those 'invisible backend changes'.">Fixed the buy-all-upgrades button.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.57<span>2015/07/05</span></h4> <ul> <li>The options page now includes a legend for standard-decimal suffixes.</li> <li>Small update to the feedback page.</li> <li>Some invisible backend changes.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.56<span>2015/06/06</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a bug with buy-all-upgrades and upgrade notification settings.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.55<span>2015/05/13</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a minor grammar error in the swarmling description.</li> <li>"Buy all upgrades" and "buy cheapest upgrades" now use your upgrade notification settings.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.54<span>2015/05/13</span></h4> <ul> <li>Upgrade notifiers have several new options: notify when buyable, notify at 2x cost, notify at 4x cost or never notify.</li> <li>Upgrades may now be hidden. (Mostly.)</li> <li title="Mouseover text changed too. Easy come, easy go.">Queen achievements have been changed slightly.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.53<span>2015/05/07</span></h4> <ul> <li>Cocoons now include a buy-exact-cost link for the maximum number of larvae you can clone, similar to the Clone Larvae description.</li> <li>Fixed some bad grammar in the locust and hatchery descriptions.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.52<span>2015/04/28</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a bug involving mutagen, visibility, the undo button, and the respec button.

It shows months/years when necessary, instead of hundreds/thousands of days.</li> <li>Some invisible backend changes. The game now contacts `https://api.swarmsim.com` much more often.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.49<span>2015/04/22</span></h4> <ul> <li>The buy-all-upgrades button is now always visible. Previously, it was visible only with show-advanced-unit-data selected in the options screen.</li> <li>Progress bar text outlining, zoomed in, looks slightly better.</li> <li>v1.0.48's hatched-per-second text now respects the velocity format chosen in the options screen.

The game now contacts `https://api.swarmsim.com` more often.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.48<span>2015/04/17</span></h4> <ul> <li>Swarmwarp duration can now display seconds. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/zorbathut" target="_blank">zorbathut</a>!</li> <li>"Show advanced unit data" in the options menu now shows information about how many of that unit you can hatch every second, based on your current income. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/zorbathut" target="_blank">zorbathut</a>!</li> <li>Added a reset button for the Kongregate minimum size option, and explained how it interacts with screen width.</li> <li>Some invisible backend changes.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.47<span>2015/04/09</span></h4> <ul> <li>Improved the 'send feedback' page.</li> <li>Made the in-game bug report page easier to find.</li> <li>Fixed a bug involving fractional creatures.</li> <li>You can now undo a mutagen respec with the undo button.</li> <li>Fixed a bug where the game wasn't saved after using the undo button.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.46<span>2015/04/07</span></h4> <ul> <li>Added home screen icons for iOS/Android/Windows Metro.

No behavior changes.</li> <li>Touchscreens can now tap to see "mouseover" text. (If you don't have a touchscreen, or have a touchscreen but don't use it, nothing's changed.)</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.43<span>2015/04/02</span></h4> <ul> <li>The "undo" button, removed from the game months ago for technical reasons, <a href="https://imgur.com/Z1eHY3y" target="_blank">has now returned</a>. You can undo your most recent action (purchase, upgrade, ability, upgrade-all, or ascension) within 30 seconds. <ul> <li>Undo works like exporting your game before taking an action, then importing it afterward.</li> </ul></li> <li>Changed the abbreviated forms of sexagintillion ("Sx" to "Sg"), septuagintillion ("Sp" to "St"), and octogintillion ("Oc") to ("Og") - they were duplicates of sextillion, septillion, and octillion, respectively. "Sx", "Sp", and "Oc" now do what most people expect when used as input.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.42<span>2015/04/01</span></h4> <ul> <li>Corrected the year shown in today's Exciting Announcement. I'm sure it's correct this time. Wouldn't make the same mistake twice, no chance of that.</li> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swarmsim/comments/310qs2/ascending_on_april_1/">Buffed mutagen.</a></li> </ul> <h4 title="Let's pretend that releasing .41 on 4/1 was part of my plan, and not just a coincidence.">1.0.41<span>2015/04/01</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a spelling error in the buy-button verbs for bats and mutations.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that caused clone larvae to link to the wrong number of cocoons.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that caused next/previous links for territory units on small screens to display the wrong empower-level.</li> <li>Some super-secret changes.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.40<span>2015/03/30</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a bug where exact-cost links for buying a group of units often gave the wrong cost.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.39<span>2015/03/30</span></h4> <ul> <li>Added a fancier input field for buy-exactly-N units. <ul> <li>Several new features: buy-percentage, buy-this-many-after-twins, and buy-until-this-many. Mouseover the input field for directions.</li> <li>Pressing Enter after typing a number now buys that many units, just like clicking the buy button.</li> <li>Standard-decimal suffixes, like '10 billion' or '10b', now work as input.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that limited how much you could buy at once. Numbers bigger than 1e300 (or 1e38 in Safari) work properly now.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that prevented the coefficient for numbers formatted like '1e10' from being anything other than 1.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that sometimes cleared numbers formatted like '1e10' while you typed them.</li> <li>The up/down arrows next to this input were, unfortunately, lost. No one used them anyway, right?</li> </ul></li> <li>All buy-exact-cost links use the new buy-until-this-many input format. Clicking 'buy' twice now buys only one extra unit, and large numbers shouldn't have rounding errors that cause them to 'miss' the required cost.</li> <li>Used v1.0.38's buy-button verbs in a few more places. Thanks <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/0x4F72">0x4F72</a>!</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.38<span>2015/03/28</span></h4> <ul> <li>Reworded expansion achievements to clarify that they don't carry over between ascensions - you must have that many expansions all at once.</li> <li>Bugfix: upgrades should no longer throw errors or be 'undefined' after using a buy-exact-cost link for a large number of units.</li> <li>Bugfix: displayed energy percentages are now rounded the same way everywhere.</li> <li>The options screen now allows you to use the old non-exact duration format ("a few seconds", etc).</li> <li>Buy buttons for units now use a more appropriate verb, instead of "buy" - drones hatch, nests build, larvae uncocoon, mutations mutate, etc.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.37<span>2015/03/23</span></h4> <ul> <li>Importing a saved game through the options screen, importing an online save, and loading a game saved in Flash storage all show the 'welcome back' screen.</li> <li>By popular demand, the options screen allows you to choose Swarmwarp as a velocity format. ("You produce 10 drones per second", "You produce 9,000 drones per Swarmwarp".) This format will show energy production in seconds.</li> <li>The energy tab now displays energy production correctly when no unit is selected.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.36<span>2015/03/14</span></h4> <ul> <li>New games, where no units have been purchased, are no longer autosaved online.</li> <li>Engineering notation now works with very large numbers. Thanks <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Shoelace">Shoelace</a>!</li> <li>Selecting territory shows a <a target="_blank" href="https://imgur.com/5TyxGvb">territory production pie chart</a>, just in time for <span title="Missed the 1:59 release time by 10 minutes, though. Dang!">Pi Day. Thanks <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Shoelace">Shoelace</a>!</span></li> </ul> <h4>1.0.35<span>2015/03/12</span></h4> <ul> <li>Logging out of/importing from Dropbox works once again. (Oops.)</li> <li>Auto-export will no longer overwrite a remote save newer than your current game. "Newer" means "time of last action", so buying anything makes your game eligible for auto-export again.</li> <li>If auto-export won't run because nothing's changed or because the remote save is newer, it'll say so on the options screen.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.34<span>2015/03/11</span></h4> <ul> <li>Kongregate and Dropbox automatically export an online save every 15 minutes. (Neither <i>imports</i> online saves automatically yet.) This can be disabled on the options screen.</li> <li>Dropbox's options screen UI has changed to be more similar to Kongregate's, and to be slightly more difficult to misclick.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.33<span>2015/03/10</span></h4> <ul> <li>Some invisible backend changes.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.32<span>2015/03/10</span></h4> <ul> <li>The anonymous feedback form works again.</li> <li>Some invisible backend changes.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.31<span>2015/03/09</span></h4> <ul> <li>The in-game feedback page has been improved.</li> <li>The energy tab's percentage now updates as time passes, and matches the progress bar exactly.</li> <li>Added basic support for inserting your own graphics (and other styling) into the game through custom CSS. (No built-in graphics choices just yet.)</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.30<span>2015/03/07</span></h4> <ul> <li>Importing saved games works once again. (Oops.)</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.29<span>2015/03/07</span></h4> <ul> <li>The options screen should no longer raise a "mixed content error".</li> <li>Progress bar estimates involving meat are no longer capped at 2 years.</li> <li>Progress bar estimates many years long are now formatted nicely.</li> <li>Very long progress bar estimates involving meat are no longer "undefined".</li> <li title="Mouseover text!">Added a critically import, but mildly secret, feature that was missing from the Nexus.</li> <li>Kongregate's <code>autoresize</code> option should once again be stable.</li> <li>The options screen now allows you to export your game as a short url, and import by visiting that url.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.28<span>2015/03/04</span></h4> <ul> <li>The nexus no longer has an "undefined" progress bar when you can afford to upgrade it.</li> <li>The unit velocity display ("You earn x drones per second") is no longer stuck. (This was only a display error, you didn't lose any production.)</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.27<span>2015/03/04</span></h4> <ul> <li>Estimated upgrade times involving units from the meat tab should now be much more accurate.</li> <li>All upgrade progress bars now display more precise estimates - "00:12:34", instead of "a few seconds". <ul><li>Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Shoelace">Shoelace</a> for contributing the code for this change!</ul> </li> <li>Units and mutations with a maximum bonus now advertise their diminishing returns in their descriptions.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.26<span>2015/03/02</span></h4> <ul> <li>Kongregate players now have the option to save your game online. Check out the options screen! <ul> <li>Kongregate doesn't sync automatically just yet - you'll have to go to the options menu and export/import by hand. This should be automated soon!</li> </ul></li> <li>Users of Internet Explorer 7 and 8 and earlier are now prompted to upgrade.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.25<span>2015/03/01</span></h4> <ul> <li>Your mutagen tab should no longer mysteriously disappear. Players who've ascended but lost their mutagen tab should now have it back.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.24<span>2015/02/26</span></h4> <ul> <li>The game should now load properly on Kongregate with Flash or Kongregate's APIs disabled.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.23<span>2015/02/26</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a typo in the description for hatcheries.</li> <li>Added a warning to hatchery mutations about the pitfalls of spending mutagen too soon.</li> <li>Fixed a bug where predicted hatchery/expansion mutagen gains were too low. (Actual mutagen gains have not changed; this was a display error.)</li> <li>Changing the Kongregate scrolling style from autoresize to lock-mousewheel now resizes the window properly.</li> <li>Some invisible changes to how Kongregate embeds the game. Fixes some bugs around Kongregate statistics reporting and other Kongregate API use. (There is a small chance this affected Kongregate's scrolling behavior for some of you, though it's not intended to - let me know if scrolling's broken now.)</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.22<span>2015/02/25</span></h4> <ul> <li>After ascending for the first time, you'll see a tutorial message reminding you that unspent mutagen generates larvae.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that prevented mutant hatcheries from being displayed as part of the bonus multiplier on the "larva" screen. (They've always correctly affected larva production; this was a display error.)</li> <li>Added more details to the description of hatcheries about larva production. It should now be easier to tell how much larvae your hatcheries are producing, compared to your mutagen.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.21<span>2015/02/24</span></h4> <ul> <li>Added a "reset upgrade notifiers" button on the ascension screen.</li> <li>Kongregate users now have the option to lock mousewheel scrolling to the Swarm Simulator window, instead of the whole Kongregate page, while the mouse is over the game. This is still a bit experimental. You'll find it on the <a href="#/options">options screen</a>.</li> <li>The standalone/non-Kongregate game now has the option to sync your saved progress to a <a href="https://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> account. Check out the options screen! <ul> <li>Dropbox doesn't sync automatically just yet - you'll have to go to the options menu and export/import by hand. This should be automated soon!</li> <li>Kongregate users - I'm working on another form of online syncing for you, too. Patience! (Kongregate's terms won't let me show you Dropbox's login screen; sorry.)</li> <li>Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Shoelace">Shoelace</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/erosson/swarm/issues/164">contributing this code</a>!</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4>1.0.20<span>2015/02/23</span></h4> <ul> <li>Saved data is now stored in three places - browser localstorage, browser cookies, and Flash storage. This should make it harder to accidentally lose your save.</li> <li>The buy-dropdowns available with no unit selected no longer cause a scrollbar to appear.</li> <li>The progress bar at the top of the achievements screen works again.</li> <li>By popular demand, the achievements screen can now be sorted by percent completed.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.19<span>2015/02/22</span></h4> <ul> <li>The list of themes now has a scrollbar.</li> <li>Themes are now hosted on the same server as the game - your browser is less likely to have them blocked.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.18<span>2015/02/21</span></h4> <ul> <li>The patch notes page now displays how many times the game's been updated.</li> <li>You can now choose from a list of color themes from <a href="http://bootswatch.com/" target="_blank">http://bootswatch.com/</a>. <ul> <li>If you were using the dark/inverted theme before, it's been removed. You're now using the (far less buggy) <a href="http://bootswatch.com/slate" target="_blank">slate theme</a>. You might also like <a href="http://bootswatch.com/cyborg" target="_blank">cyborg</a> or <a href="http://bootswatch.com/darkly" target="_blank">darkly</a>.</li> <li>Designers: you can set a URL for your own custom theme (CSS file). <a href="#/contact">Contact me</a> if you come up with something cool, and I might add it to the game!</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h4>1.0.17<span>2015/02/20</span></h4> <ul> <li>Progress bars are now displayed correctly in Internet Explorer.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.16<span>2015/02/20</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed ascension cost progress bar estimates better than in v1.0.14.</li> <li>Removed the link to a very old version of the game from the options menu.</li> <li>You can now <a href="#/cleartheme">disable the experimental dark theme with this link</a> if it's not working properly.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.15<span>2015/02/19</span></h4> <ul> <li>Setting "velocity format" in the options screen works once again.</li> <li>The autoresize scroll option now works properly after reloading the page.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.14<span>2015/02/19</span></h4> <ul> <li>Kongregate users can now find an option to use v1.0.11's autoresizing on the options screen.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that prevented estimated time from appearing on the ascension cost progress bar.</li> <li>The ascension cost progress bar now shows a more precise estimated time. (Other progress bars will get this soon; patience!)</li> <li>Experimental dark color themes for select web browsers are now available in the options menu. The old way of temporarily accessing these themes has been removed.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.13<span>2015/02/18</span></h4> <ul> <li>Errors reading and writing to localstorage (perhaps because third-party cookies are blocked for a Kongregate user) now display a proper error message, instead of a blank screen.</li> <li>Swarmwarp now specifies that it doesn't generate energy.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.12<span>2015/02/18</span></h4> <ul> <li>Removed the Kongregate resizing added in the last update.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.11<span>2015/02/18</span></h4> <ul> <li>Mousewheel scrolling on Kongregate should now be less painful. The game should resize itself as needed to avoid double-scrollbars.</li> <li>The checkboxes on the achievement screen are now saved across page refreshes.</li> <li>Your last ascension date/time is now recorded, and visible in the statistics screen. If you've already ascended, this date will be wrong until your next ascension - sorry!</li> <li>There's now a guaranteed mutagen spawn every 8 hatcheries or expansions. This is intended to help out players who've had bad luck with their mutagen spawn rates.</li> <li>Fixed a bug with mutagen spawn calculations. Your saved game's random mutagen spawns are different than they were in v1.0.10.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.10<span>2015/02/17</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed missing unit descriptions.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.9<span>2015/02/17</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed the description of the "Power Overwhelming" achievement - it now correctly says 5 nexus are required, not one. (The achievement "Phenomenal Cosmic Power" is already awarded for one nexus.)</li> <li>Kongregate now has a high score list for best time, in minutes, to build your 5th nexus.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.8<span>2015/02/15</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a bug where simply viewing some types of units would log many errors.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that displayed a description of "undefined" for some achievements.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that sometimes caused problems when buying your first nexus.</li> <li>Preparing to release the game on Kongregate. (No visible changes.)</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.7<span>2015/02/15</span></h4> <ul> <li>You can now ignore upgrade notifiers <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-up"></span> using the checkbox <input type="checkbox" checked> next to each upgrade. Viewing an upgrade no longer causes its upgrade notifier to disappear. This new setting's saved when closing the browser or refreshing the page.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.6<span>2015/02/15</span></h4> <ul> <li>Fixed a bug related to getting the public test achievement.</li> </ul> <h4>1.0.5<span>2015/02/15</span></h4> <ul> <li>The achievement earned for helping on public test is now worth no points.</li> <li>Achievements worth no points no longer display "+0 points", and aren't visible in the achievements list unless you've earned them.</li> <li>Numbers in achievement descriptions now use the number format you've selected in the options screen.</li> <li>Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when calculating upgrade costs.</li> <li>Changes to the contact-the-developer link: <ul> <li>Fixed a bug that prevented saved data from being properly sent with all messages. Saved games are now included as shortened URLs.</li> <li>Instead of one form, there's now a "contact" page with three links: Reddit PM, email, or the anonymous feedback form.

Version 1.0 means no more (intentional) resets, ever.</li> <li>The meat tab looks different. Late game units have been renamed, and there's several new units.</li> <li>Added <b>mutation</b>, a soft-reset/prestige system. <ul> <li>After your 80th expansion or 40th hatchery, building more expansions/hatcheries may, at random, provide some <b>mutagen</b>. <ul><li>If you've already built more than 40 hatcheries or 80 expansions, you should have automatically received mutagen for building them.</ul> </li> <li>Mutagen starts off inactive. To activate your mutagen, you must <b>ascend</b> - travel through space to a new world with only a few mutagen-enhanced larvae.</li> <li>Ascension requires a large amount of energy and a mature swarm. (You can't reset as fast as lots of other games.)</li> <li>There are several interesting mutations you can choose to unlock with your mutagen. Unlocking any one type of mutation increases the cost to unlock others. Plan carefully which ones you want first!</li> <li>If you'd like to try a different mutation strategy, you may <b>respec</b> to remove all mutations and restore all the mutagen you've spent. You have a limited number of free respecs, and you can pay energy to respec more frequently.</li> </ul></li> <li>Several changes to existing units and abilities. <ul> <li>Swarmwarp now costs much less energy, but no longer restores energy.</li> <li>Bats now cost 100 energy. Previously they cost 10 lepidoptera - same energy required per bat, but it's now harder to accidentally spend all your lepidoptera.</li> <li>Nightbugs now increase max energy by up to x6 instead of x4.</li> <li>Expansions now display their total percentage with condensed numbers.</li> </ul></li> <li>Large numbers of units are handled better: it's now possible to produce up to 1e100,000 meat, or any other unit. (Units are no longer limited by Javascript's usual maximum of 1.7e308.) At that point, you'll simply stop producing meat, instead of receiving buggy "infinite" meat.</li> <li>"Buy all upgrades" moved into the "more..." menu, instead of its own menu/tab. It no longer buys meat-tab twin upgrades.</li> <li>Added an option to format numbers with engineering notation.

Respeccing now refunds 100% of your mutagen, but requires a fraction of your next ascension's energy cost, <i>and</i> resets your next ascension's energy cost (that is, sets your energy-spent for this ascension to 0). You may respec with no penalty 4 times, and gain 1 more free respec every three times you ascend. <ul> <li>Respeccing was intended to be a rarely-used way to correct mistakes or try a new mutation strategy, not something done multiple times per ascension to exploit specific mutations.

(More precisely, they decrease the effect of spending energy has on decreasing ascension cost.) <ul> <li>This mutation was speeding up ascensions a bit too much. Paying for an ascension is still quicker with this mutation than without it, but not by quite so much.</li> </ul></li> <li>Ascension cost increases by 12% per ascension, down from 20%.</li> <li>Meta-mutation is about 35% less effective.</li> <li>Meat rush and territory rush mutations are about 4 times stronger. (Larvae rush is unchanged.)</li> <li>Hatcheries grant slightly more mutagen than before.</li> <li>Expansions 40 to 79 no longer grant mutagen. The mutagen tab now appears at 80 expansions or 40 hatcheries, whichever comes first; instead of 40 expansions. <ul> <li>In a new game, mutagen became visible long before you could do anything with it.

Due to twin upgrade cost changes, the button added for this in 0.1.36 is gone.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading"> <h4 class="panel-title"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#changelog01x" href="javascript:"> Version 0.1.x </a> </h4> </div> <div id="changelog01x" class="panel-collapse collapse"> <div class="panel-body"> <h4>0.1.37 <span>2014/09/25</span></h4> <ul> <li>Minor tutorial text update.</li> <li>Options menu layout changes.</li> <li>0.2.0 prep.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.36 <span>2014/09/24</span></h4> <ul> <li>Several achievements now require the correct unit count.</li> <li>There's now a button to buy exactly the number of units needed for twin upgrades.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.35 <span>2014/09/23</span></h4> <ul> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swarmsim/comments/2hb0lv/020_reset_and_release_date_friday_september_26/">v0.2.0 announcement.</a></li> </ul> <h4>0.1.34 <span>2014/09/23</span></h4> <ul> <li>Title bar icon now shows how many upgrades <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-up"></span> are waiting.</li> <li>Upgrades now have a progress bar showing how soon you'll be able to buy the next upgrade.</li> <li>More preparation for 0.2.0.
