Nothing in here is a promise until it's actually released.)</p> <ul> <li>Mutagen acts as a percent-boost to larvae, instead of flat production! TODO: screenshot</li> <li>Hatchery, territory, and clone mutations are much stronger!</li> <li>Less tedious Swarmwarp micromanagement! Swarmwarp mutations increase both cost and power. No change in time-warped-per-energy-spent. TODO: screenshot, not-intended-as-a-nerf spiel</li> <li>Rigged the mutagen dice a little. Long streaks of hatchery/expansion purchases with no mutagen should be much less likely!</li> <li>New achievements!</li> <li>New mtx - buying a mtx benefits all online players! TODO: give these mtx a name; screenshot</li> </ul> </div>
