If you like, <a href="archive/0.1.37">you may continue to play your 0.1.x save for a while longer here</a>, but you won't get any new features.</li> <li><b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swarmsim/comments/2frtef/upcoming_inject_larvae_changes_cost_no_longer/">Energy</a></b> - buy your first nexus for 3.3 trillion meat to begin generating energy. Energy is used for special abilities. <ul> <li>Inject Larvae has been renamed to Clone Larvae, now costs energy, no longer increases in cost, requires 4 nexus to cast, and has a cap based on your larvae gained per second.</li> <li>There are several other new energy-based abilities which generate meat, larvae, and territory quickly.</li> <li>Cocooning is no longer available until Clone Larvae is unlocked, and its description is now clearer about how it's used.</li> </ul> </li> <li><b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swarmsim/comments/2gu9py/upcoming_020_changes_empowered_military_units/">Empowered Military Units</a></b> - you can now upgrade your territory-generating units to a higher tier, increasing both their cost and territory gains and adding a suffix to their name. A tier 2 swarmling - Swarmling II - is more expensive, and stronger, than the final unupgraded military unit. <ul> <li>Cost, and territory per second, for unupgraded military units have both been increased.</li> <li>Expansions are much more expensive.</li> <li>Hatcheries are cheaper.</li> <li>Accomplished Ancestry (larvae from achievements) now has a territory cost, but can be upgraded up to 5 times.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Meat-generating units no longer cost territory.</li> <li>Changed twin upgrade costs for meat-generating units.</li> <li>The last meat-generating unit is a little more expensive.</li> <li>Unit/upgrade costs, whenever possible, now include a link to buy the exact number of missing units.

(Oops.)</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.22 <span>2014/09/12</span></h4> <ul> <li>Added an <a href="#/maingrid">experimental, unpolished new(er) interface</a>. Let me know what you think of it - it might replace tabs.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.21 <span>2014/09/12</span></h4> <ul> <li>Removed swipe navigation - no more accidentally moving to a different unit because you moved the mouse wrong.</li> <li>You'll now see an indicator <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-up"></span> when you can afford a new upgrade. It should be hidden for unwanted upgrades - looking at a unit/buy-dropdown without buying an available upgrade will make the indicator for that type of upgrade disappear.</li> <li>Reformatted tables a bit.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.20 <span>2014/09/11</span></h4> <ul> <li>New UI!

If you're trying to save up lots of larvae, encase them in cocoons for safekeeping so you don't accidentally spend them. Cocoons should let you use the "buy max" button without fear.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.14 <span>2014/09/04</span></h4> <ul> <li>The game's non-https address should now load properly in Firefox.</li> <li>The options screen lets you opt out of Google Analytics.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.13 <span>2014/09/04</span></h4> <ul> <li>You can now specify a much higher number of units to buy at once - it doesn't max out at 1 sextillion anymore.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.12 <span>2014/09/04</span></h4> <ul> <li>Invisible backend changes, nothing to see here.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.11 <span>2014/09/03</span></h4> <ul> <li>Upgrade costs should have more consistent order.</li> <li>Nicer, more consistent number formatting.</li> <li>The page refreshes automatically when a newer version of the game is detected.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.10 <span>2014/09/02</span></h4> <ul> <li>Inject Larvae works again. Oops.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.9 <span>2014/09/01</span></h4> <ul> <li>When buying multiple units, their total cost is shown instead of the cost for a single unit.</li> <li>The cost of the maximum number of units you can afford can now be shown as a percentage. This is off by default, visit the options menu to enable it.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.8 <span>2014/09/01</span></h4> <ul> <li>Buy-exactly-n is back by popular demand.</li> <li>Units-bought counts include twins again. (Oops.)</li> <li>Top secret voodoo magic.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.7 <span>2014/08/31</span></h4> <ul> <li>You can now buy multiple upgrades with one click.</li> <li>There are now three buttons for buying units: buy 1, buy 25%, buy max. Buy-exactly-n is gone; it was awkward to use anyway.</li> <li>Removed the buy/select mode from the top. It wasn't widely used, and was confusing if accidentally changed.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.6 <span>2014/08/31</span></h4> <ul> <li>More invisible backend changes, nothing to see here.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.5 <span>2014/08/31</span></h4> <ul> <li>Unit list is better behaved with long unit names and text selection.</li> <li>Some invisible backend changes.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.4 <span>2014/08/29</span></h4> <ul> <li>Mid-tier meat-producing units now warn players who want to start their next tier very early. (High-tier units assume you already know better.)</li> <li>Selecting a unit now shows how fast it's being produced. Statistics page has this too.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.3 <span>2014/08/29</span></h4> <ul> <li>Giant Arachnomorphs have a valid price.</li> <li>Any save state with a broken (NaN) value should have it automatically reset to 0.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.2 <span>2014/08/29</span></h4> <ul> <li>Number formatting improved for numbers below 999 decillion.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.1 <span>2014/08/28</span></h4> <ul> <li>Column buy/buy-max buttons work.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.0 <span>2014/08/28</span></h4> <ul> <li>Initial public testing release.
